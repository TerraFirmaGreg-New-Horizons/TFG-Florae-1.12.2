### Fork for TFG Modpack
# [![Foo](https://github.com/Verph/TFC-Florae/blob/1.12.2/image.png)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tfc-florae)TFC Florae - an expansive world exploration addon to TerraFirmaCraft
Welcome to TFC Florae, an addon for TerraFirmaCraft which adds a plethora of new blocks, items and much more to the world and thereby spices it up a prodigious amount! This mod is especially something for you, if you find the base TerraFirmaCraft world to be bland and boring. Want examples of what this mod adds to the table, then check out [the image page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tfc-florae/screenshots)!

## Installation
In order to use this mod, you **must** install some mods, otherwise it will **not** work! For the required mods, please see the table right below.
| Mod | What?|
|--|--|
| [SneedASM](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sneedasm) | An essential RAM optimization mod. |
| [Bansōkō 絆創膏](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bansoko) | Mod patcher which allows me to change code within TFC itself. |
| [JustEnoughIDs](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jeid) | TFC Florae ads **a lot** of new blocks, items and so much more. JEID removes the conventional ID limits. |
| [FirmaLife](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/firmalife) | This mod is nice and handy, and because I'm lazy this is required. No buts! |
| [TerraFirmaCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tfcraft) | The base TerraFirmaCraft mod. This is obviously required for this *tfc addon*. |
| [TFC Florae Lite Resource Pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tfc-florae/files/3372914) | This is a resource pack I've made which *limits* the amount of groundcover rock block variants to one. If you don't have ram issues, then this might not be something for you. |
